# SidewinderToUSBV2
Integrated Sidewinder adaptor with assembly files for various manufacturers

To use with various Sidewinder devices, there are three .hex files provided.  Only one of them can be flashed to the microcontroller at a time, so which one to use depends on which device you'll be using the adaptor with:

- 3DPro32u4-10.hex - Sidewinder Precision Pro, 3D Pro, 3D Pro Plus, or Force Feedback Pro (without force feedback support)
- adaptffbjoy-r54.hex - Sidewinder Force Feedback Pro (with force feedback support)
- Wheel.hex - Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel

Schematic and PCB files are provided in KiCad format.

Gerbers and POS files (for component placement) are included in the Production directory.

BOMs for various assembly houses are also included in the Production directory.

Note: I'm currently awaiting an initial run of assembled boards from PCBWay for testing to make sure I did the board layout properly.
